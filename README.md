# GifUploader App

This is a project for practicing react skills while we do some crazy stuff with gifs.

## Main features

- Search page: you can type some random word and we'll deliver some gifs to you (at least that's what we hope)
- Upload page: you can upload your own gifs and be a gif rockstar on the internet. Beware with fame and fortune because we all die alone, don't let this trick yourself
- Random gif: you don't know what we want? We neither. But destiny does. Let it decide your fate with an awesome random gif everytime you click on the button
- Unit tests: after all we have to believe in ourselves I guess

This is being built with a lot of procrastination and willpower, so if you want to contribute, open a issue, open a pr, feel free!
